# 1/19 & 1/23 perlin noise.
Perline noise: Perline noise is a number that adds randomness to the generation.

I played around with some of the videos and created a wave simulator using Perlin noise.

Today I worked on creating a flow field sim as I found one online and felt like doing it.
link to code:
[here](flow_fields.pde)
So what I did was follow through the tutorial and saw a lot of new functions in processing like final, and ArrayList<>

Today I watched the videos about the Missipi River basin and the pandemic simulation by 1 brown and 3 blue.

What I found interesting is that LSU was able to model and simulate a way to return the land to the Louisiana Delta use by having a projection of a map. I guess this type of projection is very similar to the projects of sand to simulate the typography in children's museums. And I sort of want to do something similar with code where there is a 2d overview of a river bank with possible cities and you can simulate the motion of that river and create new paths or create dams that stop the river from continuing.

The pandemic simulation by 1 brown and the Blue is something I want to recreate except I want to introduce doctors and cured patients. This means that I would introduce multiple new variables like mortality rate that ensures that patients also have a chance of dying which means that the death of patients should be moved into a certain box(like why would you have the dead lying around.)
