## 10/10 work day ##

today we worked with the other members to see where everyone was at and what we would do before the CTE event this weekend.
Talking to Ms. Wegshided, we found out that the project's design had to be minimalistic and not very disorientating.
consulting with the others about where they were, they said they were done or working on different versions of the design/code.
