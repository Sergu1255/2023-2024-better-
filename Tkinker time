today I work on creating the frist Appocation in Tinker which is just a normal adding and subracting calulator but I had 2 more funcations of multiplaction and division these funcations do work. However, the results do not show up in the window but instead in the console.
The next thing I will hvae to do is try to fix this problem and get the results to show in the window
