Today I countue working on my text based game that I have been making since last year. For the day I have been mostly working on fixing issues that my code(still haven't fixed them)
The main problem is that the funcation when called will not run and print the enemy type. Next time I will definetly work on shortenting the code and fixing the code when I have finished the debuging I will be adding enemies, magic, and items.
