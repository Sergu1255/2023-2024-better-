##10/23 - 27: Text Adventure - Adding Adversaries
today I finally found out why the enemy class wasn't working the reason for the failure was that I called to define a function and then called it with a variable like this 

Ex:
something = gogo(1,"10",20)
something

This finding will help me a lot with actually using the classes and objects in order to expand my game even more.
The next thing to do is start to create a fighting encounter similar to the ones in  Pokemon or Dragon quest. Which would require a lot of functions and loops
