##Work day

today I mainly worked on setting up the graph using code from a tutorial(link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9KQGRfVhA0&t=115s). however, I am having problems with trying to create an input system though tkinter that allows the user to input time and distance values that would then be translated  to velocity graphs and then accelteration graph.
